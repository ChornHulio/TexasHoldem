\chapter{Conclusion}
The improvements from phase I to phase II are very convincing. That means that the hand strengths is a good basis to make a bet on. Although the gap between phase I and phase II is not that as big as expected, an improvement could still be achieved.

One point of critism is that the bots have never played against human beings. However, the design of the poker engine designed for the project allows to add a human player without big effort.

The biggest potential of improvements are in the chosen detail settings such as context class thresholds of the phase III player. Alternatively a neural network or an evolutionary algorithm could be used instead of hard coded thresholds.
