\chapter{Introduction}
There are a lot different variations of poker games. The most popular is Texas Hold'em. Due to its imperfect information and stochastic game play it is difficult to create a reliable artificial intelligence that could compete against human players. 

\section{Aims}
The aim of this project is to design and implement a poker-playing simulator for Texas Hold'em. The project is subdivided in three phases.
\begin{description}
	\item[Phase I] Design and implementation of a basic poker engine for k-player Texas Hold'em. Implementation of a simple player who only uses his current card power to choose his action. 
	\item[Phase II] Implementation of a player who acts on the basis of his hand strength. In order to determine a hand's strength a rollout simulator is used.
	\item[Phase III] The player uses the previous history of his opponents to react on their actions. Therefore an opponent modeler should be implementetd.  It determines which action an opponent makes and associates it with the game context.
